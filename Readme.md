This is my work for the VK Cup ’22/23 programming championship. According to results of the contest, I entered the <ins>Top-8</ins> best iOS developers out of 975 mobile participants.

When exploring this code, please keep in mind that it was necessary to develop it in a very <ins>short time</ins>. I developed this solution in just a few evenings after work. And that is the only reason why I used MVC.

## Task Conditions

The contest consisted of three stages. In this repository, my work only for the second and third is published.

### Qualifying Stage

Implement the five suggested interactive formats. Develop each as a separate screen with an endless list of the same kind elements.

1. Multi-stage poll with answer options. After answering each question, show percentage of its respondents and highlight the correct answer.

2. Matching elements from two columns into corresponding pairs.

3. Dragging options into corresponding gaps in a text.

4. Filling gaps in a text by typing.

5. Rating something with stars up to five.

Evaluation criteria:
- operability and absence of bugs;
- nice animations, smoothness, attention to details;
- minimalism of the code, prohibition of any third-party dependencies using.

In the screenshots above you can see <ins>my</ins> implementations. Any ready-made design was not provided by the contest organizers.

### Final Stage

Come up with any 2 similar interactive formats and implement them. The formats should be quite complex and interesting. Provide full iOS 14 support.

I suggested the following solutions…

1. Elements Mixing. You mix suggested elements and get some result. Three different game modes are supported, you can shake your device to check the results, imitation of 3D around the hole is implemented.

2. Hot & Cold (based on the Russian folk game). You move the slider and tactilely feel where the correct answer is. The closer you are to it, the stronger the Haptic Feedback.

Also, I supported iPad, dark UI theme and landscape screen orientation throughout the whole app.

It was also necessary to prepare a 4-minute <ins>presentation</ins>, telling and showing the app in motion and telling about used technical solutions. You can find my Keynote file in the repo, it contains <ins>demo videos</ins>.
